"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.

"Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.
","Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality
","Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"Overall good but not that worth
","he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"Review update - Product failed after a few months
","Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"Good sound quality
","Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

","Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"Frequent failures.
","The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.

"Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.
","Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

"Average product
","The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation
","Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........
","I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Not a great product but great for price.
","I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Not great sound performance but overall ok
","Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

"It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.
","It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

","Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

"Good at it's price.
","I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"Earphone cables are a bit lengthy that makes irritation
","In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"Not good for workouts
","The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

"Good but not the best
","I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

","Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!!

"One of the worst earphone I’ve had
","I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

"Good Quality Sound but observed other problems
","Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

","I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.
","I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

","This is a great product. Comes in a nice box and it fits perfect in ears. The sound quality is also very nice. I tested it with couple of different songs and it is too good. I was waiting to buy it and to my luck it came on sale for 999 which is a steal price!!!!!.... I am super happy with this product... I am not sure if price will be available as the normal sale price i saw was 1900+ which I guess might be little expensive but I got it for the real deal so happy happy. 😇

"Sound quality is not good, over bassed
","I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO.

"Good one but not great !
","Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"Good buy at an affordable price
","I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

"The “Boat” experience !!
","I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

"Setting Your Expectations Right
","At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.

"A budget all-rounder by boAt
","I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"Think twice before buying!!!
","I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

"Bass lover here. But gets too bassy
","Issues.Cinnectivity.---------------The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.Sound.I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass. Atleast not while listening to music but it feels while watch a movie speciallly Hollywood.Disappointed a bit.. satisfiesld a bit.. but majorly disappointed

"Best for the price of under 1300/-
","First of all, for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires.

"Just the perfect earphone you need for everyday !!
","Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

"Terrible sound quality.
","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Conquers the competition...
","Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

"Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about
"," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

"Realistic Review of these Earphones.
","To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

","Stopped working in 3 months.Claimed warranty but it takes forever..still haven’t received the replacement as well as no email or SMS or call from Boat.Don’t buy these earphones...spent a little extra and buy Sony or JBL at least their products a good and if any issues they treat their customers better and resolve the issue quickly.I already bought another Bluetooth earphones and I guess I’m gonna wait for 7-8 months for Boat to replace their faulty product.

"Best in budget
","It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

"Lousy headphones
","I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.

"Poor quality? I would say so.
","This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

"Not lasting and 1 year warranty is useless as supplier is not reachable

","The product seemed good initially (including the design, weight balance, sound quality etc). However, within 15 days of use, it has started behaving funny as it gets disconnected after 30 minutes of use (even when mobile is in my pocket).

"This is beyond my expectations.
","More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It’s quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates.

","You can take this as a bluetooth version of boat wired 220/225 headsets.Sound and bass is great but not clear in few situations.Noise cancellation was worst to the core voices of people 10m away from you is clearly captured and irritates you to the core, don't know whether it is a product issue which i received.I missed to notice with in the return duration otherwise would of replaced it.Now i need to reach support team for replacement.

"An outstanding pair of wireless earphones - at a cheap price.
","This product's sound quality is impressive. The tagline speaks for itself - immersive stereo sound is truly what one gets. It charges quickly, and lasts for a long time (5 - 6 hours of use). I also own an Audio Technica M50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. Note that these headphones costed north of ₹9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt.

"Don't buy! Poor Quality Headphones
","First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

The only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, For better experience keep the volume at 75%.The ratings are below :-Bass - 4.5/5Vocals - 4.5/5Fit - 5/5Bluetooth range - 4.5/5Battery - 4/5

"Below average
","Really disappointed.1. There is no deep bass effect as mentioned2. And there is delay in voice and the video timing, which is really very annoying.3. Built quality is ok ok.4.

"Average sound quality
","Pros. Good and comfortable  fit , eliminates noise well  Excellent delivery speed,Cons.  Average sound quality , poor mids and highs

"Poor performance by the battery and is not up to the mark
","The sound quality is nice at this rate..... But problem is with the battery..... In half n hour it came down from 50% to 20% and at 20% started saying that the battery is down and within one minute the the headphones got switched off which is extremely poor performance by the battery moreover the only indicator is when the battery is charging that from red colour it turns into blue colour but it does not auto cut off which is why you never know when it is fully charged or not....... Now waiting for after sales services since it has a 1 year warranty will have to see what and how fast is the services after sales...... Will update once any update comes from the manufacturer

","Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product
","This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

"Great Headphones!
","Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

","Good build quality; Good battery backup; ease with BT connection; good design & fit; Sound quality is very good - crisp & clear; mid tone is excellent; treble is little harsh but can be easily control through equalizer software; bass is sufficient; lastly, voice clarity through mic is excellent - best in the market (even better than Sennheiser). Most importantly, its Samsung and one can take the benefit of readily available service centres, if required.

"Not at all worth the money....
","I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

"Must buy if u need Bluetooth n u r audiophile who prefers balance sound
","I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

"Best in its segment!
","I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

"JBL T205BT Complete Review
","I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"Not an Ergonomic Design. Not easy to Use!
","Even though, the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good, for couple of Ergonomic reasons, I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller. Seller Communication  and Delivery was Perfect and very much Satisfied.I have requested for the Refund for Earphone.

And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones.

"Lives up to the name
","My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

"Good headset if you don't mind what I've stated below
","I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile
",3,JBL T205BT
"Good sound quality with compromise in features
","Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.
",3,JBL T205BT
"Before you buy this please have a look at my review.
","First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

"Poor quality and only for listening YouTube videos.
","1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

"Not comfortable at all.
","Didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. Asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable. Starts paining in the ear after 20 mins of usage, which results into massive headache.Also there's no return policy from Amazon nor JBL as well.Feels like both companies doesn't care about customer complaint.My suggestion would be to buy another model except this.

"Regular music lovers this earphone rocks
","I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"Full indepth review of jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone.
","Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

"Very good pair of in-ear bluetooth earphones with Apple like eartips
","Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips, which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears. Noise cancellation is not that good...but I'm not that bothered about that.

"Value For Money. Highly recomended for people who loves music.
","Thanks Amazon for providing such an excellent product at a best rate.I really love these ear pods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Highly recommend for those who want iPhone ear pods shape and wireless too.Thanks to JBL for making such an amazing product at the best cost.Value for Money.But it doesn’t fit in my ear properly .

"I love them
","I was looking forward to buy something which fits like apple airpods. Eversince I came back to android eco system I missed my airpods.  I don't like those in ear type earphones.  I tried mi earphones,  oneplus bullets wireless & Samsung galaxy buds ( horrible call quality!) Nothing I liked.  But these are awesome.  Great to wear,  no strain as they are very light weight.  Sound quality is good, call quality is decent.  If you are like me looking for something other than in ear plug types, you are in luck

"Amazing sound experience
","These bluetooth headphones are awesome, JBL keeps the sound experience great as always. Pure bass, clear, and crisp trible. The music  coming out is clearly audible even in at low volumes and high traffic (road) conditions. The only concern for me is the battery does not last that long even after a full charge. I highly recommend this to every music lover out there.

"One of the best Bluetooth earphone from JBL
","A great product from JBL, as a Bluetooth earphone it's really good, no connection issue, good noise cancellation, good bass and vocals. It's light weight, will not fill any weight in the ear, good connection range. Support both android, iOS in terms of control (buttons). Connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

"Most uncomfortable HeadPhones
","One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

"Average earphones.
","Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

"The best you could get in this range. (Specifically for those who don't like the insulated earbuds)
","I am writing this review after 1 month of rigorous usage.At first I was confused whether to buy this or not. But it is worth every penny guys. Don't think twice just go for it.The earbuds are the main soul of these earphones. There are people like me out there who don't like the insulated one earbuds. This is the perfect earphones for them.Sound Quality: 9/10Mic: 8/10Battery: 7/10 (Could have been better)Noise cancelation: 5/10 (Reason being the non-earbuds earphones)Build Quality: 7/10Overall rating: 8Worth every penny

"Counterfeit product. Don't buy it.
","I received it yesterday. But I was amazed to see the poor quality of packing done to these earphones.1. Wrapped inside a cheap polycover with some Chinese symbols printed over it.2. It was tape sealed instead of air lock.3. The seal of box was not holographic. Just a piece of tape cut from tape machine.4. Quality of material used for making body of earphones is quiet cheap.I'm don't have second thoughts to, that these earphones are not genuine JBL. They are duplicate.Kindly don't buy. You can't even get refund. They are non refundable.

"Good enough ear pods at a great price
","Pros:1. Good effective bass2. Light weight and good ear fit while walking although not in-ear. For gym and running one has to check the fit3.Noise cancellation just right enough.Cons:1.Blue tooth connectivity is barely 6 m. Does not work if one walks to the next room.
",4,JBL T205BT
"Not Satisfied

"Good to Buy
","Review after 2 weeks of usage.Built quality is Good but not great.Earbuds design gives nice firm Fit in ear and is comfortable for prolonged use.  Not ideal for Sports, Running or Workout.Sound quality is great with good bass. Could have been better though. With WhatsApp, Skype (60Mbps internet) calling voice volume level is good but with same level on Phone call other party complained it being low.Battery holds charge for good enough time 5hrs. Charging time was around 1.5 to 2hrs.Signal coverage is not that great . Sound turns Robotic when you move to different room or so.  Good for distance 10-12ftOverall serves the purpose.

You can enjoy the good quality of music with bass and call quality is very good . You can't feel any pain in ear if you using for long time also and it's really fits perfectly and you will thought some times you are not wearing it .Overall worth to buy , i bought it on offer .

"Value for money
","One of those good bluetooth earphones in the market. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and the sound output is excellent.Perfect bass, no noise while listening to music with high volume. No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210, but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

Within 5 months rubber covering of right earbud removed autimatically ( glue issue ) when I check the same for left, its also having adhesion issue. I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only.

"Good Product Would Recommend
","This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"Not suitable for running. Poor sound
","Can't believe this is a JBL product. Not suitable for running due to the charging port and volume blocks being heavy causing the wire to bounce around while running and eventually pull the earphones off.

"OK OK Product #WORST MIC
","Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation.

"Not working on imo/viber/messenger calls
","Recently i bought JBL Tune205 BT. The quality of the sound is great and comfortable to use for long usage. The earbuds are same as iPhone earphones.

"Noise cancellation is poor. Worst customer support!!
","First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL, in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010

"good but not good

See I myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz I can't survive the same city without it. I keep on listening to music for hours and hours.

","sound quality is good and clear... very convenient to attend a call... i basically roam around in my office and it becomes very difficult to carry ur phone with u each time u get up from ur chair. but if you have a blootooth headphone like this, it becomes easier to attend calls from  a certain distance even if the phone is not with u. the ear plug also fits very well in ur ears. I strongly recomend this to all.

"it started giving me ear ace
","Headphones are excellent and sound quality is also good, but the only problem is that it is not very comfortable in ears. You cant use it continuously for more than 2hrs otherwise your ear will start paining.I did compare it to iPhone's headphone, and the difference and the reason for pain in ears was that the buds of JBL  headphones are bigger than that of iPhone's. And that's why not at all comfortable in ears.Now my ears are paining like hell and I had to see an ENT doctor.

"These surprised me!
","I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

"Great for Music -- Not for calls
","I purchased 2 sets of this product and been using for 1 week.Pros:Earpod style, fits nicely, no pain even after using for hours. (This is the main reason I bought)Good sound quality and BassNice build quality and looks great.Cons:No Sir/Google Now-- Very Disappointing, If I knew this, I wouldn't have bought it. I thought every earphone will have a long press google now support. Feels useless while riding bike and while walking.Very low call volume -- This is serious issue while in traffic riding bike in India.Low battery life.Not sweat proof.Poor quality audio in Skype for Business. (App shows your device is causing low call quality)
",3,JBL T205BT
"Overrated
","I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.
",2,JBL T205BT
"Sound, bass
","I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.
",4,JBL T205BT
"Good product to go with Bluetooth
","Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.
",5,JBL T205BT
"Go for it if you are not into plug in ear buds !
","Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.
",4,JBL T205BT
"Not worth the price!
","I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D
",2,JBL T205BT
"Sound quality is great but it may not be that durable.
","Before I write my review, I’d like to make clear that I DIDN’T purchase the item from the Amazon store. Regardless, I wish to write the review as I did come across one problem and would like others to consider it.I’ve had the earphones for almost about a month. I use it on a daily basis. And after first few weeks I noticed the ear-thing coming out. And I didn’t give much attention then but now it’s fully out and it’s bothersome.

Bass is there but isn't boomy hence watching movies isn't as fun nor listening to edms or hi hop.But other sound range is amazing, stereo surround is mind blowing hence sound quality is 4.5/5. Listen to some acoustics and bam, this will take you away on your own music studio, :P.....Bluetooth connectivity is okayish mediocre range works only with one device.Hence, as mentioned the pros doesn't justify the cons and nor the price.

Battery- depending on song, I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well, battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.

"Great pair of earphones
","I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

"Excellent product but cable quality could be better,
","I have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2), JBL (T 210), Sennheiser (HD 180, HD 210, CX 271, CX400 II Precision, CX 185 Street II, and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1), Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD),First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare, CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, CX 275 S is very well balanced, CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,To anyone looking to buy earphones, go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output, and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

"Bang for the Buck
","Firstly I would like to appreciate Amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. The product reached in less than 24hrs and I opted for regular delivery.Now about the Product.I have used or still use products like Audio Technica ATH-M50X , Beats Studio, Powerbeats 2 , Jaybird X2 , Panasonic Extra Bass , Bose SoundTrue, Mi Piston3, etc .These Sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. They have a very loud sound output. The bass is 4/5, Treble is 4/5. The sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.

"My Experience With The Product
","Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :👉Look And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.👉ConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.👉Battery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.👉Sound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.👉CALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos✌️👉VERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product, I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

"Best for the buck but lacks in built quality!
","Pros:Really good quality sound.Perfect balance of treble and bass.Value for money.Lightweight.Good for every genre of music.Cons:Really thin wire seems fragile I fear I might accidentally rip them with simple pull.Three button pad is big compared to the thin wire, it just looks ugly in my opinion.sometimes i hear distortion when i listen to hip hop.I mostly listen to all genres.These give better kicks when listened to rock.More dept when listened to edm.These are definitely better than the previous pair (RHA M390U) which I've owned. Enhances the sound quality. You need to have good quality mp3 files to get most out of this earphone. Gives me studio feel even when I'm in public. Earbuds are very comfortable in my ears. I could hear instruments which I've never heard before in  songs. Definitely best earphones I've owned. Feels like there's orgy in my ears when I listen to songs with these.

"Great sounding earphones with one shortcoming
","Let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

"Great sound, mediocre built
","Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ, and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass, something from Sony would be better for you.

","I would have given 2 stars to the product has it not been for Sennheiser's after sales support.The product build quality is not great and it developed wrinkles at multiple place with normal usage. The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. Even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.However, the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands, just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with Sennheiser. One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser.

","I recently bought a Sennheiser CX213 earphone for just Rs.699/- from flipkart ,over the years I have been buying headphones of different makes including Bose & to my pleasant surprise the no frills 213 exceeded all my expectations.The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a mic & comes with add-ons such as a nice leatherette pouch, two pairs of extra earbuds of diff sizes for better ear canal fit and a L cable adapter for Rs.1648 on Amazon but quality and performance wise CX213 is a much better product at less than half the price of  CX 275 S.So if you don't mind the absence of a mic and want to just listen to music or watch videos go for CX213 hands down. Quality of the wire in CX 213 is much better than that of the CX 275 S & longer too.

The most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. Nothing short of awful, it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break. Heck even the cheap ₹300 MI earphones have better build quality than this. So, an absolute no go for rough users.I would recommend this to casual home listener's who can take care of their gear.

","The battery life is a little low for my taste. Apart from that, CX 6.00BT are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). Sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the Sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser’s products are. Sennheiser is a German company, and Germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.Note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, CX 6.00BT should not be one of your choices.

"Value for money - Very Good, just short of excellent
","Used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to WOW at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell! Definitely worth the money
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Best for those who want crystal clear sound in overall frequency range.
","I think sennheiser has degraded the built quality of these pair of earphones I'm saying this on behalf of my personal experience because I have been using this earphones from 2015(from croma at rs 1600) and again I bought it in dec 2018 but from Amazon at rs1585 (price in croma rs 1699 on dec.25.2018). I found the sound quality is still ok but they have degraded the built quality .

"Nothing special.
","Nothing special if only you want to use mic then go for it good if you really want to it used for for listening music then don't go for these earphones that is distort while using with equaliser or at high volume better go for XB55 or XB75 Sony earphones which i purchased one month after this one. I think I have used XB350 earphones of Sony earlier for 2 years that is why I was not satisfied but the thing is that the build quality of these Sennheiser earphones is not good and also have distortion. Go for Sony XB55 if you really want great sound blindly.Pic attached, one side sienhieser and one side Sony xb75ap.

"Worst Product
","The product Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal Mobile Headphone With Mic (Black), it claims universal but it dose not support all MOBILE PHONE!! This vital information Amazon or seller has not mentioned anywhere and Pure case of misleading the customer.The Phone which it supports is mentioned in the inside of the packet which is visible only once you open the complete pack.The built quality is very Cheap.As it didn't work with my phone cant comment on voice quality.Total disappointment/worst product/ False claim

"Review for Sennheiser CX 275s
","Pros:1. Nice Sound quality (4/5)2. Earphone fits easily (3.5/5)3. Call quality while receiving call is good (4/5)Cons:1. Build quality is not that great because of thin wire. Either it will get cut off or tangled easily, you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityOverall  Value for money. You will get best earphone in mid range earphone.
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Total Waste
","One of the most regrettable purchases. Sound quality is absolutely horrible. Tested on various sources like 4 different phones, DAP, Headphone amps. Pathetic. Item is only replaceable and not refundable. My friends Mi Piston earphones are way better than this. Very thin and flimsy build to add to the agony.
",1,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Worth the Premium?
","Though on the expensive side of the earphone market,the cx-275s from Sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.Plenty of reasons for this support namely the Amazing Sound Quality from the Earphones,the Good looks of the headphone and German Built.However,the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.Overall,a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.

"Doesn't work on Nokia 8.
","Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse. Mutes my voice completely on the other side. Consider this if you use a Nokia phone.

"Thump !thump! Rocks u
","Thump is here....what can I say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like Bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....GERMAN ENGEERING AT ITS BEST IS WHAT SENNHEISSEER RESEMBLES.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Long Lasting and Excellent Quality
","So I have been using the current pair of CX 275s for more than 6 months now. I use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for Skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)The Sound quality is good. However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free. (Applies to the CX180 as well which I owned earlier as well)To sum it all up, if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"True to it's reputation!
","CONS:I was a bit skeptical of buying the Sennheiser CX 275 due to the reactions on it's durability. I was correct on that part, the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).PROS:Apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media, it does not stress out your ears. Noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Great headphones @1400
","IMPORTANT: This earphone is a quality product. Anywhere below ₹1400 it is a great buy. The value does drop below ₹1400 on sale and special occasions.DESCRIPTION:Included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.The bass is good and the audio clear.You may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.The wire is mostly tangle free.Noise cancellation is good too.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Very Good Gift
","It is for clarity of sound. Keeping Price in mind - it could be one of the best options. Excellent for calls. Good for Music. It is quite balanced. This is not for Bass lovers at all - about right on all bands. Loudness is perfect. You will probably not need to play it full volume ever.Cable is not sturdy or strong - be careful not for rough use.Apart from that it comes with required stuff - like variable size tips - choose carefully to get Noise Cancellation.Very Light and comfortable - you will not feel it.It has everything that is a sign of great design - L - Shape Connector, Leather Bag.Given the on-the-go use case that this product is primarily for - a Good Sturdy cable is the only thing that I marked it 4 start for - otherwise - it is highly recommended.
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Not Worth
","Definitely this is not for the base lovers. Very low base sometimes not that too. Not loud. I have to increase the audio level to 70% and higher to hear it well. Even a low range earphone can perform well compared to this. Please don't buy it. I even doubt on its originality. I used cx275 previously which was too good and this one is terrible.
",1,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Good one at Price 5300 in sale
","After using for a month, the  battery stands for 5 hr . Even if the battery is 30 to 40 % it keeps yelling , battery is low charging is required which is little bit annoying.Sound quality is good and even when traveling in trains it did not get much distracted / disconnected .Good piece for this pricing.But as the brand,  it little bit discourages regarding the sound quality while playing songs mainly the bass.
",3,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Nice earphones for the price, questionable durability
","Don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. The wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent, do NOT test its durability. Sound and mic quality is pretty good, I've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.The silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable, the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser, you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.I'd say if you're looking for cheap, good earphones with a mic, this is the one.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Worst. For 1700 this is a crap
","Worst.  For 1700 this is a crap. Can think to buy for Rs. 699. Poor bass genuinely there is no bass.  And there is no option for return . Replacement of the same product nonly available. Disappointed totally.
",1,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"All rounder
","Have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. For me, this ticks all the boxes, perfect sound quality, light weight, good fit and in ear comfort. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.Only drawback is that no pouch came along this. Last year I had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch, but this one even though double the cost, did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"If it's original, it's good.
","This is the second time I've bought this brand and model. The first was 1.5 years ago and it lasted me a whole 1.5 years before dying on me.This model from Appario Retail has barely lasted me 2 months before sound is fading off and on in my right earbud. Wondering if it's an original/refurbished model. Plan to check with the Sennheiser store.
",3,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"My favourite so far
","If it falls in your budget, get it. That's all there is to it.I was restricting my budget to 900 because I have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use,so I kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. Finally I decided to get it and it's great. I loved the cx 180 and this is even better. Very crisp,clear and decent noise masking. It's light,it's comfortable. It's got a mic that makes superb calls. I don't think you can beat this ,despite the premium over the JBL c100SI

"The Pursuit of Perfect Sound.
","Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180, then CX 3.00, and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble, Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

"Awesome!!
","I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

"Sennheiser, sadly  this is one of your bad ones!
","The earphones are stylish and fit perfectly well in you r ears as you place them in.You don't need to press it in unlike other earphones, reducing the damage, typical in-ear earphones cause your ears.Coming to the sound quality, the high and mid frequencies can be heard very clearly. Wouldn't say 5 on 5 though. Listening to the low frequencies or the bass in other words was quite disappointing for the price you pay. Bass quality - 2 on 5.Overall you could but them for ₹1000 bucks may be. It's not worth ₹2000.It's disheartening even writing this as I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.I've used the CX180, CX275s and both were worth the buy. Amazing products by Sennheiser. But the CX 2.00 is not just not worth it but you could buy the other two that I mentioned above as they're cheaper and better I believe.
",3,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Excellent pair of headphones
","I like the clarity of these headphones. Noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. However, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. I found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. Hence, I usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. However, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. Overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!

"Worth it.
","First of all,  I love the design of the earbuds, very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. Only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)

"Just okay. Wire too brittle
","The sound is absolutely superb for this price. No complaints. ALSO a superb faux leather pouch free with it!Cons:The plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. So it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.The wires are very thin and round. Feels very flimsy. I don't know how long it'll last. I'd recommend some wire protectors.The in ear plugs are just okay. Not too happy about the shape and size of it.

"Sound quality is marvelous
","I'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.Material quality:The build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.Durability:After 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.Sound quality:The most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.They're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.To sum up:It's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.I say go for it.Ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

"Middle of the road. Your mileage may vary.
","My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.
",3,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Absolute value for money
","These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika, Thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"The best sound but delicate build
","Its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass, although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. As it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is, it’s great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider’s higher sports model or try Sony, Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.

"Best Bluetooth Earphones Under 10000
","Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones, but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear  , resulting in true sound. Yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP, but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.

"Excellent option at a very reasonable price
","I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

"Review after two years. Great earphone but not for rough use
","prior to this earphones i have used JBLT150A, Sony MDR-EX150AP, Sennheiser CX 180  all of them were good products which lasted 2 years  except JBLT150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested Sennheiser CX 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

"4.2 for sound quality.. great product under 2k
","Review post using this earphones after a weekGo for it !!!!!My highlights with priorities for this earphones:1. Thump : more than enough thump for the beats which also produces a more than decent amount of bassA kick-ass hearing experience. For that if you could adjust little bit of your equalizer well from internal setting then it will be with you for sure2. Clearly awesome in highs n lows n mids as well .. again make proper equalizer even if you don't do it its there ..sound quality is just there3. Vocals - if there are more than a person singing a song at a time . Trust me you can hear both the voices clearly along considering above 2 points (bass, highs, lows and mids)4. Best fit in the ear - small and light weight so you don't have to adjust now n thenSome improvement areas -Need to give promising build qualityWires are very thin but decent to useEarbuds given are not that comfortable so I replaced them with my old ones

"Best product under 3k category
","Perfect mix of bass and treb.So soothing for ears,can listen to music for hours.Having headphones from various manufacturers, I can assure you this one is deffinitely a fantastic product given the price range of under 3k.If you want extreme bass plz opt for brand sony or JBL.Wire build quality is good,though not 100% tangle free somewhat good avoiding tangle,can see pics attached.Overally 4 star from me.

"nice product from Sennheiser
","I have been using Sennheiser CX 275 for last 1 year and i am very happy with its overall performance. The build quality is excellent, sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation is good.One important note : - i had issue with one of the earpiece ( noise was not coming) within 3 months of purchase. But Sennheiser has superb after sale service. They replaced and gave me a new pack of Sennheiser CX 275.

"Worth every penny spent
","The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product’s life.Altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant. Be cautious and order accordingly, unlike me.

"Excellent audio quality and noise cancelation but left right polarity is flipped
","Ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

"Best Value for Your Money
","Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.

","I was searching for a earphone/headphone with best mic response. Almost experimented 9 to 10 brands and various models but this particular model (Sennheiser CX 275), its the only one that completely meets my expectations.  Therefore, I purchased this product thrice, twice from online and once from croma store.The only thing of disappointment is it's durability. Its doesn't last for a year. All became unserviceable.

"Near Neutral Audio Experience.
","I am a person who commute most days, 6 hours up and down in train. So music of all geners and movies from around the world occupy most of my journey time, all these years. So to listen to music and watch movies without fatigue and noise of the train is very much important for me. To put in short, this ear phone is neutral. Sound quality of this ear phone is  very good. Those who love neutral sound (which is the best option to listen to all types of music), can very well opt for this. Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But....... This product is not worth what it costs. The same quality of Sound can be obtained from a JBL  C100SI earphone as well (Durabilty of the mentioned JBL product is below average. I couldnt even use it for one year)  but it costs only half the price of this  product. I cant say anything about durability at this moment, since i bought this just one day back only.Hoping for the best...

"Best one
","It has been more than 3 years since I bought this headphone. Iam completely satisfied with it. But one side of the headphone has stopped working now and Iam thinking of buying a new one. I have been contemplating for a while but could not think of any other product than this one. If Iam going to buy a new one, it will be the same model. For any headphone, 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out, it will definitely last much longer. Usually in any headphone , one side of it stops working because the wire near the plug portions gets worn out with time.

Not big issue can be managed.Product comes with two years warranty under 2k which says a lot about product quality and duration to use without any hassle.

To compare, I also have Sony WI-C400 in-ear headphones but it gives poor audio, inspite of comfort of neckband i have to forgo it for sake of voice clarity on wired Sennheiser CX 275.

After not more than a month of use, microphone is not working. Dealing with Senheiser Customer care now. Don't go for these ear phones. There is a reason why they are selling for 2.5k while the MRP of product is 4.5K. Because they are bad performing. Don't buy them.

When the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially Google assistant) on it's own. I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass. Even when I set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. Infact the cx180 I had before sounded better than this.

As much as you are tempted to buy them, DON'T!Even audio technical clr100 & JBL c150 si sounds mcuh better than these.I  extremely Regret buying these

"No Longer the best under 2K
","The major issue with this IEM is the build quality. The wire is so thin, it's almost on the verge of being invisible. The plastic used for mid and earset doesn't give any assurance either. The sound compared to other recent earphones in the same price segment is at best passable. The bass isn't rich, the music doesn't feel lively, although vocals seems fine.The right-side earphone stopped working after a year and a half, no  doubt due the higher probability of wear and tear with this set.Skip this, and go for Byron's or SOUND magic E 11 C

"sound is perfect but not worth the price
","Sound quality is perfect in both low and high volumes also well equipped with bass. but paying such a price i also demand better built quality. it seems very fragile and even the cord is not tangle free on which i compromised. it is not a complete package i would say so if you are going to get this one you have to compromise on some of the aspects.

"Best earphones you can buy in this price range
","First of all, I love Sennheiser. There's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. Earphones are very durable. These have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). But I just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. Cord has been pulled numerous time. Twice, I thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. But, I underestimated it. I got these as an upgrade from CX 180 after using them for 3 years. I recommend these.

","keep in mind to turn the volume dial down....these thing is scary loudand more scary when you add a portable amplifier with it............and for the ones who need a flat tone... don't mind taking it.....just tweak the equaliser to vocal or more mids and high to nullify the bassy side of it. loved the scary volume

"Buy if you are seeking only sound
","1. Build quality is not the finest. You cannot expect such a low build quality from a Rs1400 earphones(price at the time when I bought it) from a brand like sennheiser. Specially the wire is  too thin.2. Sound quality is great , just what you expect from sennheiser. Bass is punchier. You can get a little bit of cracking in sound above 85%3. Definitely not a value for money product if you are seeking for good durable earphones

"Could be better
","It's light weight, and sound quality is descent. Only thing what I don't like is it's not durable. The wire with connector jack is fragile. You need to always take extra care. Personally I always like the ones which has right angle with connector jack which protects most of the time.

"Premium headphones at budget price.
","I could not find any headphones at this price range or below which provides awesome sound quality. But the wires are so delicate and if not handled carefully, there are greater chances of the wire being damaged. Been using it the past 1 year and after 8 months, the left earpiece stopped working. But was able to claim warranty without any hassle. Just make sure to buy it from reputated sellers to avoid getting non authentic one's.

"The Leader of wired headphones.
","Sennheiser CX 275 are the best wired headphones available. The concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass. One can put on these and listen for hours without any fatigue. Bass heavy headphones cause ear fatigue. The quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.

"Sound quality is great. But the cable is are almost torn after few months of usage

But the hardware part especially cables are so thin that a normal usage would tear them at the joints.I used it while running and in gym. the cable are almost torn.It is a great headphone to be used at one place such as office desk.Overall, go for it, if you want to have a static use of it.##Update: It has been a year now.

","Awesome earphones I have ever used. I am big fan of music and high quality sound fascinates me. For me, compromising sound quality is a big deal. But, this product lives upto my expectations and beyond that! After using this earphone, I don't feel like using any other products.

"Placement in Ear
","When I first tried these ear buds, I did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.This morning, I seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1,000 fold.The size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. The bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. The only downside I see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. Hope to have provided a helpful review.

"Normal
","It sounds normal in Samsung Note5 (its performance is only equal to the  performance of earphones came with Note4). In Other devices such as xperia z3, lenovo vibe x3, etc, its not that good, except rich bass sound. Its performance doesn't justify its cost.

"Sound quality is MEDIOCRE. Don't buy if you are use to listen music at high volume.
","Quality of sound is not as good as Sony XB55 or even Samsung's inbox in-earphones. As volume is levelled up above 70% sound quality starts getting rediculous. Cable quality is unacceptable. It is quiet easy to get damged. At this price consumer should not focus on brand name rather focus on quality of sound. Moreover, it doesn't not have volume rockers keys.

"Good
","Fulfilled by Amazon, so packaging was good. It came in a compact packing. Quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent, though I didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the TV or somebody talking. You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again, it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals. This is tested on Samsung S3 as a headset. On apple ipad as a headphone. The volume up down buttons were not present. While some commented that it is thin (and it is compared to my stock Samsung headphone), it is not fragile.

","I've used Sennheiser before. This has more than decent sound quality. But the biggest turn off is that it doesn't come with volume control on wire. Only one button is provided that connects/disconnect the call and Plays/pause music. For controlling volume you'll need to take out the phone every single time. That's a big let off for me.

","After through research & my Friends recommendation I made my mind to purchase CX 275s from Sennheiser within my budgetThe Sennheiser CX 275s is a good headset for someone who wants microphone functionality and Bass response is very well and I can say its better than JBL

"All I'd say is GOOD!
","The sound quality is really good. No distortion. No proble amazing. The material used is not very strong so i would not recommend using it roughly. If you use it properly and take care of it properly, it would really last long. You should buy it if you are a casual music listener.

"Nice headphones with mic at an affordable price
","This is my 4th sennheiser product over the years and I really like its sound quality, not exactly as the premium Sennheiser headphones which deliver a unique sound. This one is bassier. Small, extremely light weight and a microphone that works well. Although I feel its not durable due to the plasticky built but nothing happened so far.
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Best headset within 2000Rs. Period
","If what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass, Not overpowering, but the right amount for a song as such. Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality, The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.
",5,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Awesome customer care service
","First of all i wanted to say that Sennheiser customer care service is awesome they just replace your product if it didn't have any physical damage., Very rare company replace your defective product hand to hand in just 2 3 minutes.I think this cx275 s have some mic issue other people did complaint that your voice is not clear.
",4,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT
"Works fine
","I'm a little confused over which side goes in which ear, as there's no marking for L and R. The output is nice, but has to be pushed inside the ear a little more than normal earphones to get the proper bass output and quality of sound.

"Material quality can be improved
","I have bought the earphone and faced issue of mirophone. Even after replacing the earphone facing the same issue. It looks like this is default problem in all the headsets maybe manufacturing defect. Please provide feedback to company. There is a delay in changing tracks using microphone button. Also, the earphones do not work while answering the calls for the first time. It works while answering the call second time.

I must say that the durability of sennheiser earphones is marvellous as I tried using the skullcandy earphones before and they wouldn't survive for even  last 3 months.

"Loved it!!
","Awesome sound quality! I love it :-)The box contains my CX275s, two extra earbuds (one large, one small pair), carry pouch.I just listened one song on this, would update more later.EDIT: They worked for 2 years straight on. This is really good. I purchased on 29 Aug 2015 and only around Oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. It cost me Rs.1791 for 2 years, that is Rs. 2.4875 per day. Any other Rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. The sound quality is really good. I am not a bass-head, I don't want my eaphones to boom base. I like music, and these are perfect. They don't focus on base. These earphones got pulled on many times, when I thought these would be done. They got twisted. It suffered through all that and didn't stop working. So it's durable.

","AWESOMMMMMMEEEEEBought this from Cloudtail, Good quality and fast delivery. Coming to the Headphones, These are Bassy. One of the best pairs I own till date. I have owned Sony, Samsung, HTC, Lenovo, Beats and my previous best earphones the MI Pistons 2.I used to think the Piston had some good Bass and clarity but after hearing the Sennheiser cx275s, Am just in Aw. And the best part is that the performance is out of the box, The headphones will get better with play.You can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. Also the Mids are good(Not best but still pretty nice). Highs are also pretty nice.ONLY CON:The Wires seem very Fragile. Too thin.Mic seems ok quality. But You buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic

"Not worth the price.

"Sennheiser CX275 S short review.
","The Sennheiser CX275 S is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. The brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. The only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. Since it is priced higher, the quality of the wire can be changed.Otherwise, the earphones is a good buy.

"Thumbs up
","Good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. Sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. The carrying case provided with it is a nice. I got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

","I am just loving listening Sennheiser CX 275. Every instruments of music/song is clear and distinct, base is there and it is as it should be, enough to enjoy without feeling hurt. It has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. I am enjoying listening at every level of volume. Under Rs. 2000/-, the best bye !

"Quality and sound class in-ear earphones
","This is the second time i bought this model as 1st one got accidentally damaged in my hand. The sound quality is awesome and the right amount of bass is set. It comes with an extension (L shape connector) which is a must if you always keep your phone in pocket. But the extension piece is not compatible with my OnePlus 6.

"Best headphone under 2k,no doubt about that.
","I have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen, and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagCons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

"Average earphone, avoid if you are looking for great noise isolation.
","As mentioned in several other reviews, this is a good earphone.I bought this based on some reviews that mentioned about excellent noise isolation.My experience is that the audio is a bit low on bass, and provides noise isolation just about as much a local 100rupee in ear phone.Also, the wires are tangle prone.

"Buy only if you are not satisfied with the normal Headset.
","Though the consignment was received well in time, the product does not meet the standards mentioned on the site. Its a normal headset. With no additional bass ( Which actually what I was looking for). 7 Out of 10 times the call receiving button does not functions. I have to use my cell phone to receive or end the call.  The ear plugs fit properly, and does not slips out and feels comfortable for long listening hours. Sound is not incredible but its just above the normal ones.

"Lives up to the expectations.
","The CX275s is a really market worthy earphone. The bass is amazing, you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. The vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. Movies, songs, games, calls, radio all sound amazing.The noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the Apple or Sony headsets, but this one fits extremely well. People now tap me to draw my attention, it's that good. The build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.I got this product at a lightning deal during #FreedomSale and the product arrived on time, so no complaints with Amazon's delivery. However, the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one. Not sure if Amazon or Sennheiser will replace that as it's been more than a month now and I never registered a grievance on the same.

Noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.Cons:To get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %.

"Ultimate Music Experience
","The best Headset in low range for pure music listening.  I earlier had a Sony regular headset which was complete in itself.  The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music.

"pretty darn good !
","I was really skeptical when buying these as I have never used sennheisers before , was really torn between these and Sony xb30 series but decided to go for these as the Sony ones felt a bit uncomfortable and too bass heavy .First of all build quality is pretty good .9/10Excellent noise cancelation was able to hear to everything clearly even while driving at 100km/h on my bike . 10/10Sound is very well balanced ,decent bass ,decent treble got almost everything I expected from thesePeople who listen to edm  will love these ,heavy metal listeners maybe a bit disappointed.All in all these headphones are great and 2 years warranty is the cherry on the top.

You can feel the sound waves grooving inside your head, if the music you're listening to is intended to be felt so, I mean, that is possible with this product. And the carrying pouch is nice, by the way.The only con, you can't hear what your friend is telling you sitting beside you.

"One of the best

Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that.

"Worthy for its price.....Must buy
","When i was looking for an ear phone with call facility, every one was suggesting samsung and other brands. At max they suggested to go for sony.I had an experience of Sennheiser CX 180 and they were far better for listening training video than Creative ep 630.I thought to give it a try and luckily i was successful. These ear phones are made to listen voice calls and perfect in listening music as well.Guess what after me, two of my friends also bought the same ear phone for them.Truly worthy for their features and their price, oops i forgot  - you get two years warranty replacement

Taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. Even  while driving on a busy road, a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass.

Even half price other brand earphones are much better than this.One good suggestion, before purchasing any earphone, first use it.Ask some one who is using it to give you for trying.(don't feel hesitant, its your question of satisfaction, better be known before than crying afterward )Try it and when you are satisfied with the sound  then only purchase it.

(CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. A BIG NO NO. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.

There is mic also which makes taking calls easier, however no volume buttons . You have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume.

"Serious bass response with a light, secure design
","The Sennheiser CX 275s is an earphone pair geared towards the bass lover on a modest budget. At Rs. 1690, it's neither cheap nor over-priced, and offers solid, distortion-free audio performance. The boosted lows will scare away purists, and even bass fiends might find the highs, which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots, occasionally tinny or harsh. An inline remote control and microphone add value to the CX 275s, but the remote lacks volume controls, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, the CX 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love,Pros - Powerful, distortion-free audio performance with deep, boosted lows. Inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices.

","First of all thanks to amazon for a superfast delivery within a day......Guyzz.....if u r searching for a earphone with mic under 2k then go for it......don't give a second thought......i really liked this earphone......perfect bass....treble...clarity......It's mic also works perfectly with my redmi 3s prime.....so don't be confused with another review which says mic doesn't work properly with 3s prime.......Worth The Money......

"Overall good but Little imbalanced sound
","Thank you amazon for quick deoivery. I researched a lot before buying this earphone usually I buy 3-4 headsets every year. I have used  sony and sound magic es10 recently but this is cx275 is better then both. I wish they could have controlled the treble and lows more. Sometimes it feels very loud though I was able to control that by help of equalizer. I am using this with my one plus one and its working good. Since I have started using it recently I can't comment on the durability but wire is very thin. Pouch is ordinary and additional ear adapter sets are as u get with any other product. So overall its a good buy in this budget range.

"Jack problem...

"I got these earphones and a brilliant price of 1300 bucks
","I got these earphones and a brilliant price of 1300 bucks! It has stunning clarity for music and for calls. I loved the fact that there is an additional pouch to carry these earphones. Even other expensive brands wouldnt provide a pouch at this price point. I checked multiple websites and still got the best price on Amazon. At a sub 1500 price point, these are definitely a must buy! Excellent bass and treble balance. The add on connector sent with the earphones is a fantastic add on in case you are using older android phones where this connector is a must-have. Just buy this earphone without any second thoughts if it hits a 1300 or 1400 price point. Amazon as always, you rock in your delivery.

At first I was skeptical, because I read some of the poor reviews but now that I've tested the product (great delivery time btw), I find it really balanced, in terms of bass, treble, voice clarity, loudness and noise cancellation. Also, I didn't find any discomfort with long duration usage. I just ordered another piece of the same earphones for my mom.All in all, a great purchase. Very satisfied.

"Another great experience with Sennheiser
","As usual Sennehiser gave the best audio. I was using Cx 180 earlier but due to no mic in that, I bought this one and it is obviously more crisp and clear in quality that 180. Though the product is priced more than 180 but it is worth it. Covering more frequency than 180 on both ends gives this product an extra value for the buck and also another great experience with Sennheiser.

","These have got to be one of the best headphones I've had in a very long time. It knocks the socks off its competition with the greatest of ease.Points to ponder -1) At this price point, you cannot get a better product, build is very sturdy2) The base on these things is incredible, treble and midrange kicks butt3) The noise reduction is very good4) Pair this with a Fiio headphone amp (Any one) and you might just go insane

"Good under 2k
","One of the best earphones with mic below 2k. I wouldn't say the bass is great but it's decent enough. Audio quality depends upon the bitrate, so better download the songs in 320kbps to enjoy the audio quality of the earphones. Build quality is good.Though the wires get tangled quite often, I find it easy to untangle it compared to other wired earphones. You get an earphone pouch to carry around.

","Skullcandy makes affordable quality products. I have had 5 different items during the course of last 3 years and not a single disappointment.Pros:-• 5-6 hours of battery with 'highest' setting of volume, maybe more with a lower setting.• Spare earbuds• Comfortable fit. For those who think the band may cause uneasiness, trust me, you won't even feel the band on your neck, it is featherlight.Cons:-• NoneBrilliant Bluetooth headset, highly recommend prospective buyers to invest in this quality product.

The rubber is just perfect on your ears they dont hurt at all.  yes you may have to clean them once in 2 to 3 days so they dont give you an ear infection (that s the case with any ear phone ) a device worth the buy , has lasted me over 5months now . i expect it to last longer .:)

"I am changing my review over this.It stopped working within a year.
","the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, I used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). The console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. Now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.Skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except India.WOW.... it's just a year of warranty u get in India and upon calling they told me that Skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and I have to buy a new one. This wasn't expected from Skullcandy, I am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. I would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.

"Worth Buying..
","I have using this product for 4 days now.Sound quality is as expected,No issue about it at all.Battery Back up is also good around 6 hrs, gets charge quickly.Call communication is also loud & clear no prob at all.Fits very well ..Only thing is bluetooth range it works fine in same room or if phone is in direct sight. If any obstacles are there in between then only it drops connectivity.

"At this price tag its best. Mid bass is good
","Got delivery on time. Do not compare this earphone with wire earphone. As this is Bluetooth based wireless earphones it compresses the sound quality hence we don't get amazing sound quality as wired. I have compared this earphone with Sony SBH70 which is costlier then this but same result. So I will recommend this earphone at this cost the bass is good not amazing but mid range is amazing try listening song with 320kbps bit rate MP3 songs. Only disadvantage is you will not get the sound quality like wired one. Although it's best earphone at this price. Listen song just by tweaking equaliser you won't be disappoint.

It has a little lesser range of bluetooth though, signal interupts over closed doors. Output is not very loud but generally ok. Most importantly being a sports range headphone it is not waterproof, mine got damaged due to sweating in gym. Asked for replacement from ccare but no reply since 15 days.

I might be missing a trick here, but if anyone knows if there is a way to mute the mic without muting from the phone or laptop would be interested to know

","The controls stopped working within 3 months of use!!!!

They ate under warranty but you have to send the earphone to Noida at a cost of RS. 400+ , which you have to bear.  Even my Skullcandy Method stopped working but a bit later after using it for 10 months. Got a replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 days of use!!!!!Do not buy Skullcandy earphones, better buy Sennheiser Momentum wired for Rs. 4.5-5K.  Quality is much better.

"Best Sounding wireless Earphones for this range
","I have been using this headphones for a week now and I have never seen or heard a much more beautiful elegant earphones at all.  The best in bass and crisp raspy sound. People say that the neck band is slightly discomforting..  But I'd say No..  I wore them seeing 2 good movies back to back and I did not feel discomforting at all. Makes u feel as if this is not there on your ears and neck at all.Pros1)Perfect fit on the ears2)Very light weight compared to other wireless earphones on market3)Good Bass4)Amazing design and the neck bands do come out and go in very easily5)Very very quick and easy pairing for my One plus phone. BTW it supports dual pairing.6)Call connection is good and it my voice is very clearly audible for the other person while on phone. Mic is good.Cons1)Battery life isn't more than 6 hours as I fully charged the earphone and watched 2 movies back to back which was around 6.5 hours and it beeped for low battery.2) The earphones without the neck bands may be a little and I mean slightly little issue as they tend to slide back off the neck.  If the beck bands are attached, it stays put.3) No one touch Siri or Google now which is the only thing I did not like as I am a great fan of those. While driving if u want to call someone then u have got to remove your phone and dial which is sometimes irritating as I feel.On the whole this  is a beautiful piece of device for 60$ or 3200 INR. Please go for it as it's perfect for good listening with good bass and very comfortable for long hours of gym and musicHope you like my reviews and thanks for reading them.

I got a replacement as it was under warranty but the new piece also had the same issue after @ 6 months. As it was now out of warranty, I negotiated with the seller who gave me his display piece which again had the same issue within a couple of weeks. I tried various solutions available online to troubleshoot but it simply refuses to get switched on. This clearly proves that there is something fundamentally wrong with the product.I strongly advise against purchasing this product or rather any Skullcandy product for that matter.

"PureBass Performance
","Got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. Connectivity and Range: Very Good. It powers on fast and pair easily & quickly, and I can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. Sound:  Decidedly average. It is definitely boosted, so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy, no problems. Sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. Distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. Usability:  They fit snugly, and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. Calls: Under normal circumstances these are fine. Person on the other side had some problem hearing me when I've used these while cycling.5. Battery: Good. I use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. They charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. Battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.Overall: Easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. Battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. However, if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience, I'd say pass on this one.

","Listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. I hope God forgives these souls for making these earphones, because I know I can't. I am a JBL fan. I use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. They're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement.

The output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.Can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since I bought it.

",4,JBL T110BT
"Value for money
","Got them for about 2K, and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. Definitely worth the price.Sound quality: Average, but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. The bass isn't as punchy, and the treble could have been more defined. But, there is no noise, so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). The volume is a bit lower than wired earphones, but there is no distortion at peak volumes, not that it should be used at those. You could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1K, so that makes sense, considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.Battery life: Now, this could be done better. Either the should have given a larger battery, or had better battery management software. It doesn't turn off if it is paired, but not used for an extended period. So, you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.Durability: uses flat wires, and the built ""seems"" sturdy. Definitely better than my Sennheiser earphones.Other features: call quality is decent enough. Mic is not that great, need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. Buttons are decent, and work without fail. There is a bright LED on the control capsule, lets people know you can't hear them. Wire is a bit too long, could've been a couple of inches shorter each side, but the balance is good. Fit snugly in your ear, doesn't fall out. The earphones bundle up nicely, and take practically no space in your pocket.Overall, given the price, meets my expectations. Wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6K or more, but doesn't disappoint for the money I spent.

","Was a big fan of JBL untill i received this product. The sound was not upto the mark. the voice on calls was pathetic as the reciever was hearing loud noises other than my voice. Bass was not proper. better to go with a wired earphone instead of buying this. It was looking so big on neck and was not manageable for runs and workout. Immidiately ordered return and amazon took lot many days to first return it and i am stil waiting for my money to be processed so that i can order a different earphone.

","Third class product and can't contact JBL customer support through call or email. Headphones battery doesn't hould charging even after charging overnight and it drains in few minutes feels like Amazon is good at  selling cheap products nor JBL or Amazon is ready to take responsibility.

"Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
","This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ₹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+ and also on an iPhone 7+ and it was all the same.

I am stuck with this faulty piece. :(have bought on a higher price than Portronics (becuase of brand image, JBL) but regretting now. :( :(

"Awesome product
","Awesome product. Battery backup is about 5 1/2 - 6 hours when i am using it continuously. Have been using it for more than 3 months. No issues faced. If your usage is within 5 - 6 hours at a time my suggestion go for it. Voice is clear when speaking, lightweight. Bass & sound quality is great but does depend on the app you are using in your phone to listen to music. I have tried with JIO music, Amazon music, jet player etc. Most of the players gave excellent output. I guggest try with different players or equalizer settings to get the perfect audio. The wires are tapered in shape hence can sustain a little bit of stress. 3 different size of earbuds are available with this product and selecting the correct size does not allow the buds to fall off (Tried it when running on a treadmill). All in all awesome product at this price.

"Not worth your time.
","Terrible Bass. This product does not justify the name given to it. I bought a Portronics Por-766 Conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the JBL. I wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.I cannot believe I fell for this brand and model name like this. I wish I hadn't bought the product.
",1,JBL T110BT
"Good sound quality but low on durability
","Pros: Crisp sound. Good bass. Good volume range.Cons: Works smoothly for the first month or two. Post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand), so the sound falters. Initially I could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music, but later on there was so much of connection stability issues, I had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct, unobstructed range from the device. You can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.Eventually, it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone, because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.I had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). The condition of the replaced product is the same now. Might get it changed again, I think, because its still in the warranty period. The good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions, as long as you have the valid invoice with you.

"Perfect companion to your ears and soul.
","After a long research to get my BT Headset in the price rage of Rs.2000, I finally landed with this one. I'm happy about this choice. I explored Ant, Tagg and other brands but the JBL brand value and its wider service network given confidence. Surely it's simple yet powerful headphone. very elegant design, no non-sense outfit. Perfect for several hours of music. It is having magnetic lock, which is not mentioned in the product page. In the pack, it has different sized three pairs of ear-bud caps, the subtle Orange in the ear-buds presents its beauty very presently. As far as sound concern, it is JBL. I already own speaker and over-head phone from JBL, which are performing for several years consistently. This also proves its quality. Good bass and clarity, even in minimum to maximum volumes. If you have high resolution audio files, it is perfect companion. The mic placement is not friendly and no carrying pouch is given so, I deduct one star for it.

"Just Bass not Extra Bass or Pure Bass

First replace medium ear bud with small size bud. It places tightly in the ear. Thus feel more bass

"Just Fine for the price range.
","In ₹2000 price range its a fair purchase. The sound quality though is not that up to mark, at least not what I expect from JBL. Its not Pure Bass as it says its just a lot of Treble and I hate it. Overall its OK just turn on the EQ and change it to Bass Booster but it will lower the volume a little and you can hear the outside world clearly. The design is neat and very attractive but the placement of the mic is not a suitable position. The Bluetooth sometimes disconnects when multitasking. I faced this problem while I was playing PUBG and suddenly someone called when I picked up the phone it disconnected that is very annoying every time as you have to go through the Bluetooth settings to reconnect. Rest its all right. Afterall we should not forget we are getting all that in ₹2000. So that’s quite okay. Its not a compromise its a good purchase.

"Guys, JBL is always the best.
","This is the best bluetooth headphone I've found in this price range and this has come new in the market recently. Specially the magnet ting in the ear pieces are awesome, it's the most helpful thing.In the box it says ""Pure bass"", bass is not that high but audio clarity with effects is really good. While listening to some tracks I feel that treble is little high but that I've solved by using equalizer on my phone. It took me about 1 hr 40 mins to charge and goes on full day well.The wire which is at the rear (neck area) should've been a little longer and front ones a little short because it's sometimes difficult to find the buttons for changing songs or picking up the call.But overall according to my experience JBL is always the best. No matter what product you buy from them their music quality is always the best.

","this device here received a tons of negativity on Amazon and other sites but just a quick note that when we shift from wired to wireless the sound quality really affects so if we have to compare we should do it with other wireless earphones not the wired one .The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is good. Perfect for EDM lovers Electronic dance music.The connection range is amazing .It's really easy to connect to new deviceson the physical overview, it has got a really big neckband which is kind of annoying most of the times and it has 3 buttons - one to play and pause  music or receive call or end and the other two to change the music as well as to change volume, depending the time u press those keyswhen we talk about the looks of the device it looks good if you are wearing a shirt or a t-shirt with a collar so u can hide the neck ban in the collar if not then it's uncomfortable and also looks awkward at the same timeat a price point of 2000rs and jbl branding it is a fair pricetime for the big deal the pros and conspros;Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is good. The output of a fully charged device is around 6-8 hours  depending on the volumebuild quality is amazingCons:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides aboutThe magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.bass is not much as jbl devices are known for high bassThis is a great device but the wireless earphones lacks in either sound/battery/looks/comfort and this one lacks in comfort

"a tip to improve the quality of sound in this headphone who are feeling it is poor in bass
","well i would give it (4-1)star for a reason... sound is really good and with deep basss but with a catch here. i had bought the headphones and was very disappointed for a flat bass and lots of treble sounded waste of 2k... but then i had spare ear buds of sony mdr wired earphones (spare buds) which were perfect fit on jbl ones and woah the sound felt amazing really worth the jbl sound series..... well the biggest problem is with the too hard ear buds provided with dosent give full isolation to bass effe t to shape...so people who have already bought try replacing the earbud with any old headphone you have which are useless

"Pick these up blindly if you get them below 2k
","Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. Have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.I use Audio Technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. Bought these JBL Bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.Pros:Charge lasts about 5 hours.Lightweight.Produces very clear sound.Bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.Cons:Slightly more expensive than I'd have liked, I paid 2250...Microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating.

","This is a decent earphone considering the sound quality, brand value and cost. Don't expect thumping bass response from its 8.6 mm driver, the sound is not flat or full though. Give it some time to burn in the speaker to get the real sound of it. The call quality is horrible with this , you just can't roam around the rooms and talk, also the mic position is problematic. The build quality is average and is made of plastic, the wire is tangle free and of good quality. My first set have one of its speaker casing fall out of place, so have to order a replacement. Overall, it's a decent earphone.

"well its a jbl, but then...
","hey guys. bought it. used it. has a bass boost apparently, but it doesn't seem bassy enough for some reason. my Samsung wired headphones were better on that aspect. plus if ure planning to use it for running, dont buy this. the wireless aspect is not helpful as the wires keep bouncing in front of your face. tooo cumbersome to keep pushing them away during runs.

"Decent earphones for the price
","Good quality, sounds good. Takes a little time to get used to the sound, balanced sound, bass is not overpowering. Magnets on the earphones work only when placed correctly. It won't just cling to eachother if you want it instantly, you'll have to bring the magnets together properly.

"Excellent..Just go for it..
","Have been using them for few months and I found them quite good for the price...They are quite good and you don’t have to worry about them falling of as you can tie them around your neck and both stick by magnets unlike apple air pods where you alway fear of losing them...Music sound quality is good and voice calling quality is ok...battery backup is really nice..After months of use I will definitely recommend you all to go ahead with these wireless headphones...
